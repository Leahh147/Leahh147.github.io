Hi, I’m Jiahao He — currently a Master of Engineering graduate in Information and Computer Engineering at University of Cambridge. My academic focus lies in Artificial Intelligence (AI), Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Reinforcement Learning (RL), and biomechanical user modeling.

I’m particularly interested in autonomous agents and multi-modal systems that can perceive, reason, and act in complex environments. My goal is to build agents that can understand and interact with the world through multiple sensory channels, with applications in intelligent interfaces and embodied simulations.

Feel free to reach out if you’re interested in collaboration or discussion!
