Hi, I’m Jiahao He, an MEng graduate in Information and Computer Engineering at the University of Cambridge. My research sits at the intersection of Human-Centered AI, Reinforcement Learning (RL), and LLMs, with a focus on building AI systems that support transparent and reliable decision-making in societal contexts.

I’m particularly interested in how autonomous agents and multimodal models can help people understand complex environments, evaluate policy trade-offs, and make informed decisions. My goal is to design interpretable, responsible AI systems that collaborate with human users, especially in high-impact domains.
