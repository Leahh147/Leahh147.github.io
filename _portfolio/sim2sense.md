## Problem

Most biomechanical RL environments rely heavily on visual input, limiting realism
under sensory uncertainty.

---

## Solution

SIM2SENSE extends SIM2VR by integrating **auditory perception** into the RL loop,
allowing agents to leverage spatial sound cues.

---

## Technical Highlights

- PPO / SAC in PyTorch  
- Unity + MuJoCo simulation  
- Spatial audio encoding  
- SLURM-based HPC training  

---

## Results & Impact

- **18% faster convergence**
- Improved robustness under visual degradation
- Enabled new user study conditions

---

## My Role

- Defined research direction
- Implemented Unity–RL interface
- Managed large-scale training & evaluation
